# AI Won’t Make You a 10x Dev. Reading the Docs Will.

AI is incredible at speed. It fills boilerplate, suggests patterns, and answers “how” fast. But speed without understanding is a trap. If you’re treating AI as a shortcut, you’re probably getting further from mastery, not closer.

## The Shortcut Trap

- AI makes you feel productive while skipping the learning that compounds.
- You ship code you can’t fully explain, so debugging turns into prompt roulette.
- You copy patterns without the context—why they exist, when not to use them, and what they trade off.

That gap is invisible—until something breaks.

## The Day I Closed the Chat and Opened the Docs

I tried to stand up a monorepo with Turborepo using AI. It got me “something” running, but it felt off: configs I didn’t understand, edge cases unaddressed, and a nagging sense I’d missed something critical.

Then I did the unfashionable thing: I read the docs—end-to-end. In one sitting I got the mental model AI never gave me: what each config does, how caching actually works, how tasks compose, and the constraints that matter. It was slower upfront and 10x faster after. Suddenly the errors made sense. So did the tradeoffs.

## What Docs Give You That AI Can’t

- First principles: the “why,” not just the “how.”
- Constraints and guarantees: what the system promises and what it doesn’t.
- Canonical patterns: the baseline you should deviate from only with intent.
- Edge cases: the stuff that kills you in prod but rarely shows up in snippets.
- Shared language: the terms your team and ecosystem use to reason together.

AI can synthesize all this—but only after you’ve internalized it enough to ask the right questions and recognize wrong answers.

## Use AI Without Getting Dumber

- Docs first (or alongside): skim the overview and concepts before coding.
- Ask AI to explain the docs back to you or generate examples from a spec you just read.
- Offload scaffolding, not thinking: let AI write boilerplate; you own architecture and boundaries.
- Verify with sources: cross-check code suggestions against official docs.
- Capture understanding: keep a brief “why” file per project; don’t outsource your memory to a chat log.

## The Unpopular Truth

Mastery isn’t hackable. The 10,000 hours idea isn’t a meme—it’s a reminder that depth takes time and deliberate practice. AI amplifies the understanding you already have; it doesn’t replace it. If you want to be faster later, slow down now and read the docs.

AI is leverage. Documentation is foundation. Use both—in that order.
