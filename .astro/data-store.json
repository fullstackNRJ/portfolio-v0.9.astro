Next.js is like a luxury SUV that can do everything but might be overkill for a quick trip to\n\n> \"Astro is like a chef who only serves what you ordered. Next.js is the buffet. Both are delicious, but your stomach (and your Lighthouse score) will notice the difference.\"\n\nWelcome, web devs! Today, we’re pitting two of the hottest meta-frameworks against each other: **Astro** and **Next.js**. If you’re building a portfolio, blog, or even a SaaS, you’ve probably considered both. Let’s break down the hype, the real-world tradeoffs, and see some code in action—Fireship style.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- **Astro**: Ships zero JavaScript by default, islands architecture, best for content-heavy/static sites, super fast, easy to learn, but less mature ecosystem.\n- **Next.js**: Full-stack React, SSR/SSG/ISR, huge ecosystem, great for apps, but can ship more JS than you want, and sometimes feels like configuring a spaceship to make a sandwich.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Rendering Models: Islands vs Everything\n\n**Astro** uses [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/concepts/islands/). Your static content is pure HTML, and only interactive components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) get hydrated as needed. This means:\n\n- Blazing fast initial loads\n- Minimal JS by default\n- You choose what runs in the browser\n\n**Next.js** is React-first. Everything is a React component, and you choose between SSR, SSG, ISR, or client-side rendering. This is powerful, but:\n\n- More JS shipped by default\n- Hydration everywhere\n- Sometimes you just want a `\u003Ca>` tag, not a React router\n\n### Example: Astro Island vs Next.js Component\n\n```astro\n---\nimport Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';\n---\n\u003Ch2>Astro Example\u003C/h2>\n\u003CCounter client:load />\n```\n\n> **Tip:** If your component relies on browser APIs or needs to access the DOM, use Astro’s `client:only` or `client:load` directive. This ensures the code runs only after hydration on the client.\n\n```astro\n\u003CCounter client:only />\n```\n\n```jsx\n// Next.js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}\u003C/button>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Data Fetching & Routing\n\n**Astro**: File-based routing, Markdown/MDX support out of the box, fetch data at build time (great for blogs/docs). No API routes (yet), but you can use endpoints or serverless functions.\n\n**Next.js**: File-based routing, dynamic routes, API routes, middleware, and more. Fetch data at build, request, or on the client. Great for apps, dashboards, and anything dynamic.\n\n### Example: Blog Post in Astro vs Next.js\n\n```astro\n---\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\nconst posts = await getCollection('blog');\n---\n\u003Cul>\n  {posts.map(post => \u003Cli>{post.data.title}\u003C/li>)}\n\u003C/ul>\n```\n\n```jsx\n// Next.js (getStaticProps)\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const posts = await getPosts();\n  return { props: { posts } };\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Bundle Size\n\n**Astro**: Ships only what you need. Static by default. Lighthouse scores that make recruiters weep with joy.\n\n**Next.js**: Can be fast, but you need to work for it. Tree-shaking, code-splitting, and careful use of dynamic imports are your friends.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ecosystem & DX\n\n**Astro**: Young but growing fast. Integrates with React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and more. Great docs. Some rough edges with advanced use cases.\n\n**Next.js**: Mature, huge ecosystem, Vercel backing, tons of plugins, middleware, and community support. If you need something, it probably exists.\n\n---\n\n## 5. When to Use Which?\n\n**Use Astro if:**\n- You’re building a blog, marketing site, docs, or portfolio\n- You want the fastest possible site with minimal JS\n- You love Markdown/MDX\n\n**Use Next.js if:**\n- You’re building a dashboard, SaaS, or anything with lots of interactivity\n- You need API routes, auth, or server-side logic\n- You want React everywhere\n\n---\n\n{/* ## Interactive Example: Carousel Generator (Astro Islands in Action)\n\nBelow is a real interactive tool built with Astro + React islands. Try it out!\n\n\u003CCarouselGenPage client:only /> */}\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBoth Astro and Next.js are fantastic. Astro is the new kid with a killer static site game and a bright future. Next.js is the Swiss Army knife for React devs. Pick the one that fits your project, and don’t be afraid to mix and match. The web is big enough for both.\n\n---\n\n*What do you think?

Last month, I caught myself watching cat videos at 3 AM while three deadlines loomed over my head. That was my rock bottom. But instead of beating myself up, I decided to experiment with my digital habits. What happened next surprised me.\n\nHere's your practical guide to rewiring your brain, backed by my personal experience and cognitive science. No meditation apps required (ironic, right?).\n\n1) Week 1: Embrace the Void (AKA Make Boredom Your Friend)\n- Pick your \"Offline Sunday\" - mine is every Sunday from 8 PM to Monday 8 PM\n- First challenge: Delete TikTok and Instagram for just 24 hours\n- Warning: You'll feel phantom vibrations. Your thumb will mindlessly tap where the apps used to be\n- Pro tip: Keep a \"craving journal\" - note when you reach for your phone and what triggered it\n- Real talk: The first 8 hours are brutal. I nearly caved at hour 6. Push through.so how do you unfry your brain?\n\nYou need to reset the system. Not with vague “be mindful” platitudes—but with structural changes that hit the same levers the platforms use on you.\n\nTry this, starting today:\n\n1) Make boredom legal again\n- Carve out 24 hours with no feeds: no shorts, no infinite scroll, no “For You,” no autoplay.\n- Expect the first 8 hours to feel itchy and weird. That’s withdrawal. Keep going.\n\n2) Week 2-3: Dismantle Your Personal Casino\n- Experiment: I logged my screen time for a week. Shocking result: 4.5 hours daily on infinite scroll\n- Action steps:\n  * Move all social apps to a folder named \"Really?\" (yes, the shame helps)\n  * Set up Desktop Mode: Instagram/Twitter only on computer, max 30 minutes\n  * Install Freedom or Cold Turkey - I block everything from 9 PM to 9 AM\n  * Turn off autoplay everywhere (yes, even Netflix)\n- Unexpected win: Found time to finally start that side project\n\n3) Week 4: Hack Your Visual Triggers\n- The Grayscale Challenge: Turn your phone to grayscale (Settings > Accessibility)\n- My experience: Instagram looks depressing, TikTok feels boring, and ads lose their power\n- Create a \"Conscious Layout\": \n  * First screen: Only tools (Maps, Calendar, Notes)\n  * Second screen: Communication (Phone, Messages)\n  * Third screen: The \"Think Twice\" folder with all social apps\n- Result: App opens dropped by 70% in first week\n\n4) Front-load effort before reward\n- Do a 10-minute “cold start” work sprint before opening any feed each day.\n- Stack it with a cue: sit, press timer, start. The win becomes your new early dopamine.\n\n5) Replace junk novelty with real novelty\n- Micro-adventures: new route to work, new café, new park, new recipe, new instrument.\n- Novelty without algorithmic drip re-sensitizes your brain to real life.\n\n6) Protect deep work like it’s a newborn\n- 50-minute focus blocks, phone in another room, single tab, full-screen only.\n- End each block with a deliberate, non-digital reward: sunlight, water, stretch, walk.\n\n7) Track what matters\n- Each day: minutes scrolled, minutes focused, how you felt after both.\n- Watch the curve switch: less scroll, better mood, more output. Data beats denial.\n\n8) Rebuild serotonin on purpose\n- Sleep like it’s sacred.\n- Sunlight before screens.\n- Protein at breakfast.\n- Move your body—short, intense bursts count.\n- Talk to an actual human. Yes, in person.","src/content/blog/how-to-unfry-your-brain.md","eb094a121be71ffe",{"html":152,"metadata":153},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-8-week-brain-reset-challenge\">The 8-Week Brain Reset Challenge\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Look, I’ve been there.
